# I'm in the final in SweClockers contest btw!

Since I wrote what I was planning on doing with the Intel Galileo I got from SweClockers contest I thought that I would show some pictures on the "final" product. It's a bit crammed in the greenhouse but it works as intended (woho!). If you want to see the source code you can click [here][aws-source-code].

Anyway, here's some pictures I took last night with the help of the wonderful camera on my Nexus 5:
